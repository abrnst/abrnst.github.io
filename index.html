                    <p>Hi world! I am a 31 year old web developer student at UT bootcamp. I am a graduate from Lamar University with a bachelers degree in Accounting.  After a few year in that field I quickly realized that account was not for me.  I wanted something more. Something more creative.  After messing around in with online coding and elementary web development, I quickly found out what I wanted to become. A Web Developer!</p>
